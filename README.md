# Spiritual Journey Game

Spiritual Journey Game is an interactive, narrative-driven game developed for class discussions on spirituality and psychology. The game explores themes of faith, identity, and transformation by challenging players to navigate complex interactions in various community settings (churches, counseling centers, home environments, etc.). It draws on psychological theories of spiritual progression, including Fowler’s stages of faith, cognitive dissonance, and identity development.

## Overview

In this game, players create a character by selecting one of three profiles:
- **Devout Christian** – Characterized by traditional, steadfast faith.
- **LGBTQ+ Christian** – Navigates tension between personal identity and institutional belief.
- **Questioning Atheist** – Emphasizes skepticism and a rational approach to spirituality.

Once a character is chosen, players explore a map filled with different locations (Traditional Church, Progressive Church, Megachurch, Counseling Center, and Home). At each location, players interact with the environment through actions like "Talk to Someone," "Read the Bulletin," or "Reflect." These interactions affect three core gauges (Faith, Social, Stress) and the character’s internal beliefs.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Gauges:**  
  Each decision dramatically impacts the character’s Faith, Social, and Stress gauges. Larger impacts per action lead to quicker narrative shifts and earlier endings.

- **Belief Evolution:**  
  The game tracks and displays the character’s evolving beliefs. Beliefs update frequently—using a mechanism inspired by psychological models of spiritual progression—providing immediate feedback through a visual epiphany alert.

- **Tailored Narratives:**  
  Interactions and dialogues are tailored based on the character type and location. For example, progressive church scenarios encourage inclusivity and can prompt even traditionally devout players to reconsider their rigid beliefs. Each location (e.g., Traditional Church, Progressive Church, Megachurch, Counseling Center, Home) offers distinct narratives and gauge effects that reflect the psychological tension between personal identity and institutional expectations.

- **Multiple Endings:**  
  The game features a range of endings determined by gauge levels and belief changes. Endings include:
  - **Positive/Neutral Endings:**
    - **Deepened Faith Ending (Devout):** Your unwavering devotion evolves into deep, fulfilling spirituality.
    - **Self-Acceptance Ending (LGBTQ+):** You embrace your true self, uniting identity and spirituality.
    - **Balanced Wisdom Ending (Questioning):** Your blend of skepticism and openness leads to a compassionate, balanced worldview.
  - **Negative/Interesting Endings:**
    - **Faith Crisis Ending:** Rigid faith crumbles under relentless doubt, leaving you spiritually adrift.
    - **Identity Suppression Ending:** In trying to conform, you’ve lost touch with your true self.
    - **Existential Nihilism Ending:** Constant questioning erodes meaning, leaving life painfully empty.
    - **Burnout Ending:** Overwhelming internal conflict results in isolation and exhaustion.
  Endings trigger sooner—after roughly 5 impactful actions—so that every decision has significant, immediate consequences.

## Purpose & Discussion

The game is designed as a discussion tool for classes exploring spirituality and psychology. It simulates how personal beliefs and external influences interact, showing how challenging or reinforcing beliefs can lead to growth or crisis. The game also illustrates the psychological impact of social support versus isolation and how cognitive dissonance may lead to transformative change.

Educators and students can use this game as a starting point for discussions on:
- The balance between tradition and personal identity.
- The dynamics of faith crises and spiritual transformation.
- The role of questioning and skepticism in personal growth.
- How internal beliefs and external influences shape one’s spiritual journey.
